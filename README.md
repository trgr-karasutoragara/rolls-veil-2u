# rolls-veil-2u
A prototype tool for re-evaluating knowledge claims under a “pseudo veil of ignorance,” inspired by Rawls. It helps users avoid blind reliance on authority by separating dimensions of reasoning (logic, evidence, ethics) and re-weighting credibility factors. The project is documented in Japanese, with source code in .zip.
